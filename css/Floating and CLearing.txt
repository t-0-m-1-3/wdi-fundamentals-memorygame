Floating and CLearing
content flows from top to bottom
what about columns or text to images?

floats and clears are two new css properties

block elements stack on top of one another

create and number 5 div elements. color them to distinguish them.

change the widths and they still stack

floats move horizontally, and allow different stacks. allowing left, right, or none. none is default

fall in line, line inline elements.

change it to right and they'll be listed right to left. 

window sizes will keep order when  adjusted.

float objects Creating multiple columns, arranging text around an image, and having a logo and navigation menu on the same horizontal line in the header.

issues: floated elements don't add to height of object. 
objects further down don't know where to go

clear:both
tells the browser you've floated elements, but doesn't work all the time

not clearing the div can cause wrapped text to appear behind images instead of in article format, footers may try to wrap columns.

.clearfix:after{
	visibility: hidden;
	display: block;
	font-size: 0;
	content: " ";
	clear: both;
	height: 0;
}

attached an after portion, and needs to pay attention to chil height. 

horizontal navigation
