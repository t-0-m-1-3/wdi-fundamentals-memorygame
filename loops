loops

collections are groups of values. an array is  an example of a collection. 

iteration: process of doing something repeatedly. 

loops are tools for iterations. 

While loops: run as long as a condition holds true. 
while (conditon){
	//blocks of code
}

plan your way to escape a while loop in order to avoid it taking up resources.

for loops
useful when using a loop to operate on an array.

for (i=0; < var.length i++){
	//code to run
}

the loops needs three things:
initialization
condition
finalExpression

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1){
	// do something 5 times
}

for loops are useful while moving over arrays while loops are most useful for conditions
